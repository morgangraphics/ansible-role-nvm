# Ansible Role: NVM


Installs NVM & Node.js on Debian/Ubuntu and RHEL/CentOS


Ansible weirdness with SSH and (non)interactive shells makes working with NVM and Ansible a bit problematic. This [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22256884/not-possible-to-source-bashrc-with-ansible) post explains some of the things other people have done to get around this particular issue.

## Where other roles fall short
Other Ansible roles that install NVM and/or Node.js fall short in a few areas.

1. They use the apt-get or yum packages to install Node.js. This often means that the Node.js package is older than what is currently available via the Node repo. In some cases, those packages may not be a LTS release and if you need multiple node versions, you're out of luck.

1. They will often install NVM and Node.js as `root` user (`sudo su` or `become: true`). This can add to the headache of permissions related to NPM plugin management in addition to being an unneeded privilege escalation security risk

1. You cannot run ad hoc NVM commands


## Where this role differs

1. You can install NVM via wget, curl or git
1. You can use NVM just like you would via your [command line](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage)
1. You can install whatever version of Node.js you want
1. Doesn't install NVM or Node.js as root

## Installation
1. Clone this repo into your roles folder
1. Point the `roles_path` variable to the roles folder i.e. `roles_path = ../ansible-roles/` in your `ansible.cfg` file
1. Include role in your playbook


## Example Playbooks

Playbooks are set up as an 'either/or' situation in regards to `nodejs_version` AND
`nvm_commands`. It is one or the other, it cannot be both. [See Notes on NVM Commands below](#nvm-commands)

1. If you just want to install NVM with the latest LTS version of Node, just include the role as is.
1. If you want to just install NVM, with a specific version of Node include the `nodejs_version` as part of the role (see simple).
1. If you use `nvm_commands` you will have to add the `nvm install <VERSION>` explicitly (see more complex).

#### Super Simple (Installs latest LTS version of Node)
``` yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: ansible-role-nvm
```

#### Simple (Installs a specific version of Node)
``` yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: ansible-role-nvm
      nodejs_version: "8.15.0"

```
#### More Complex
``` yaml
- hosts: dev
  vars_files:
    - vars/dev.yml
  roles:
    - role: ansible-role-nvm
      nodejs_version: "{{ config.dev.version }}"


- hosts: prod
  vars_files:
    - vars/prod.yml
  roles:
    - role: ansible-role-nvm
      nvm_install: "curl"
      nvm_dir: "/usr/local/nvm"
      nvm_commands:
       - "nvm install {{ config.prod.client-1.nodejs }}"
       - "nvm alias default {{ config.prod.client-1.nodejs }}"
       - "nvm run default app.js"

```

## Notes on NVM commands

1. If you specify `nodejs_version` and `nvm_commands` as part of your playbook, `nodejs_version` will be ignored.
1. If you do not explicitly specify the `nvm install <VERSION>` as part of the `nvm_commands` e.g. `"nvm install v10.15.1"` Node.js **WILL NOT** be installed and any subsequent commands **WILL NOT** WORK as expected.
1. NVM is stateless in that if you have multiple versions of Node installed on a machine, AND you have not set a default e.g. `nvm alias default v10.15.1` you may have to run `nvm use <VERSION>` as part of your script to run the Node version you want/expect.

## Issues
If you are getting a `"cannot find /usr/bin/python"` error. It is due to OS's that run Python 3 by default (e.g. Fedora). You will need to specify the Ansible python interpreter variable in the inventory file or via the command line

```
[fedora1]
192.168.0.1 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3


[fedora2]
192.168.0.2

[fedora2:vars]
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

```
or
```
ansible-playbook my-playbook.yml -e "ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3"
```







## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values see [defaults/main.yml]( defaults/main.yml)

The Node.js version to install. The latest "lts" version is the default and works on most supported OSes.

    nodejs_version: "lts"

NVM version to install

    nvm_version: "0.34.0"

List of [NVM commands to run](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage). Default is an empty list.

    nvm_commands: []

NVM Installation type. Options are wget, curl and git

    nvm_install: "wget"

NVM Installation directory.

    nvm_dir: ""

*NVM will, by default, install the `.nvm` directory in the home directory of the user e.g. `/home/user1/.nvm`. You can override the installation directory by changing this variable e.g. `/opt/foo/nvm`. This variable will respect Ansible substitution variables e.g. `{{ansible_env.HOME}}`*

NVM Profile location Options are .profile, .bashrc, .bash_profile, .zshrc

    nvm_profile: ".bashrc"

NVM source location i.e. you host your own fork of [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

    nvm_source: ""
