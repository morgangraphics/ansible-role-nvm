# NVM Default directory
# NVM will, by default, install the .nvm directory in the home directory of the user e.g. /home/vagrant/.nvm
# You can override the installation directory by changing this variable e.g. /opt/nvm to put it into a
# global space (meaning not tied to a specific user account) if you wanted. This variable will respect
# Ansible substitution variables e.g. nvm_dir: "{{ansible_env.HOME}}/.nvm"

# Options are wget, curl, git

# The location of the SHELL profile that will source the nvm command from. There are two potential contexts to consider,
# globally, meaning everyone who logs in will have access to nvm (which may or may not what you really want)
# e.g /etc/bash.bashrc, /etc/profile, etc.
#
#  OR
#
# On a per user basis tied to a specific user account e.g. /home/vagrant/.bashrc
# This role will create the appropriate profile file if it doesn't already exist.
#
# If you specify nvm_profile: "/home/node-user/.bashrc" explicity and the node-user is not a real
# user on the box, then nvm will not work as you expect. become_user and nvm_profile path are
# symbiotic
